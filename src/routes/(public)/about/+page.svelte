            Hi, my name is <b> Elliot MorrisonðŸ‘‹</b> <br><br> I wanted to make a web-app with Sveltekit, where I could play around with it's features, UI libraries, design, and showcase some mini coding projects<br><br>... as well as other random ideas I'd want to implement. <br><br>This is the result of that desire. Looking to add more projects as time goes by. I hope you enjoy it.
